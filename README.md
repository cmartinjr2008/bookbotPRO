# Description:
#   This program is an expansion on the bookbot guided project from boot.dev.
#   it is designed to accept any .txt document and analyze its contents. This is
#   more or less just a project I'm using to figure out how python works. 
#
# Method:
#  The program really justs loops through a given list multiple times at different points
#  and is as granular as the user wants it to be.
